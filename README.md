## Information
- **Smurf Attack** is a network layer distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, named after the DDoS.Smurf malware that enables it execution.
Smurf attacks are somewhat similar to ping floods, as both are carried out by sending a slews of ICMP Echo request packets,Unlike the regular ping flood, however, Smurf is an amplification attack vector that boosts its damage potential by exploiting characteristics of broadcast networks.

- **TCP SYN flood** (a.k.a. SYN flood) is a type of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that exploits part of the normal TCP three-way handshake to consume resources on the targeted server and render it unresponsive,Essentially, with SYN flood DDoS, the offender sends TCP connection requests faster than the targeted machine can process them, causing network saturation.

- **Wi-Fi deauthentication** attack is a type of denial-of-service attack that targets communication between a user and a Wi-Fi wireless access point. 

- **CAM table overflow** MAC address flooding attack (CAM table flooding attack) is a type of network attack where an attacker connected to a switch port floods the switch interface with very large number of Ethernet frames with different fake source MAC address. ... The switch can not save any more MAC address in its MAC Address table

- **ping of death** is a type of attack on a computer system that involves sending a malformed or otherwise malicious ping to a computer. A correctly formed ping packet is typically 56 bytes in size, or 64 bytes when the ICMP header is considered, and 84 bytes including Internet Protocol version 4 header.
